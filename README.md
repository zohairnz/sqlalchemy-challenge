# sqlalchemy-challenge
This was a two part challenge:

Part 1:
In this part, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. I specifically used SQLAlvhemy ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib.

Part 2:
In this part, I designed a Flask API based on the queries developed in Part 1.
